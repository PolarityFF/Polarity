***Seems like v4 has some fps drop issues, probably the memory release feature which needs to be revamped. v5 will address these issues.***

# Usage

1. Head over to the release tab on the right (https://github.com/FileFilza-sudo/Polarity/releases)

2. Choose the latest version of `Polarity`

3. Extract the downloaded file which can be found in the downloads folder of file explorer

4. WIP

~~4. The folder will contain a config editor ``PolarityCFGE`` and Polarity client itself correlated with its version number **PolarityV4Client**~~

This version is currently buggy, do not use unless you need to.
